Django Notes:

note to be in the right directory and have django env activated.

New Project: django-admin startproject project_name

create app inside project: python manage.py startapp app_name

run django project on server: python manage.py runserver

Process: create project -> create app -> create views (return HttpResponse)
          -> urls (import views from app_file) (add url / path to urlpatterns)
          ->settings.py (add app_file in INSTALLED_APPS)
          -> runserver with python manage.py runserver

          practice adding urls.py for each app. where project's urls.py will have this shape
          from django.contrib import admin
          from django.urls import path, include

          urlpatterns = [
              path('help/', include("AppTwo.urls")),
              path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
          ]

          -> and the shape of urls.py in the app folder will look like this:
          from django.urls import path
          from AppTwo import views

          urlpatterns = [
              path('', views.help, name='help'),
          ]

Templates: Create a templates folder inside your project folder. Inside the settings.py
            create the TEMPLATE_DIR by joining the BASE_DIR and 'templates' using pathlib
            -> BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
            ->TEMPLATE_DIR = Path.joinpath(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
            Now, inside the settings.py file go to the TEMPLATES -> DIRS and
            put the directory for templates folder which is TEMPLATE_DIR.

            Inside the templates folder create folders for each apps and then a html file inside app folder to make it more modular. put a template tag in the body
            -> {{insert_me}}
            Now, in the views.py in the app_name folder, edit the fucntion with this code
            -> def index(request):
                my_dict = {'insert_me':"Hello I am from views.py"}
                return render(request,'app_name/index.html',context=my_dict)
